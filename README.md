## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create a gold price prediction model based on historical data. This is achieved by using a decision tree algorithm. The model is trained and tested on a dataset containing gold prices and related variables.

## Methodology

The methodology followed in this project includes the following steps:

1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Loading the dataset
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Data visualization
   - Correlation analysis
4. Preparing the data for the model
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets
   - Encoding target variable (Gold Price)
5. Building and training the Decision Tree model
6. Making predictions with the model
7. Evaluating the model
