## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create a gold price prediction model based on historical data. This is achieved by using a decision tree algorithm. The model is trained and tested on a dataset containing gold prices and related variables.

## Methodology

The methodology followed in this project includes the following steps:

1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Loading the dataset
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Data visualization
   - Correlation analysis
4. Preparing the data for the model
   - Splitting the data into training and testing sets
   - Encoding target variable (Gold Price)
5. Building and training the Decision Tree model
6. Making predictions with the model
7. Evaluating the model


## Results

After building and training the Decision Tree model, we use it to make predictions on the test dataset. The results can be visualized by plotting a scatter plot of the original gold prices against the predicted gold prices. This helps us understand the relationship between the actual and predicted values.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates how to create a gold price prediction model using a decision tree algorithm. By evaluating the model's predictions, we can assess its accuracy and make improvements if necessary. It is important to note that decision trees might not be the best algorithm for predicting continuous variables like gold prices, and other algorithms such as linear regression or neural networks may yield better results. However, this project serves as a starting point for understanding the process of building and evaluating a predictive model.
